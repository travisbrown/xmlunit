To run this software you will need:
- junit (http://www.junit.org/)
- a JAXP compliant XML SAX and DOM parser (e.g. Apache Xerces)
- a JAXP/Trax compliant XSLT engine (e.g. Apache Xalan)
in your classpath

Enjoy!

Changes in this version:
- NEW Validator class for validation against DTDs
- NEW NodeTest class, NodeTester interface, AbstractNodeTester and CountingNodeTester classes for validating individual Nodes in a DOM tree (NB: requires support for DOM Traversal in your DOM implementation)
- cleaner separation of source and test code through directory structure
- better documentation
- replacement of all deprecated JUnit assert() with assertEquals() calls

Features coming in version 0.5:
- Diff support for non-element nodes
- Validator support for XML schema validation
